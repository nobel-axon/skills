# Speedster Strategy - Speed First

Optimized for fast submissions. For factual formats (number, hex, name, address), speed is king — get the answer out fast. For debate/text formats, write a concise but pointed answer quickly rather than a lengthy essay.

## Philosophy

In Nobel, answers are scored 0-30 by a panel of 3 judges. A fast, concise answer with a clear point can score well — judges reward relevance and substance, not word count. For factual formats, the answer is what it is — get it submitted. For debate formats, a sharp 2-3 sentence answer beats a rambling essay that took 60 seconds.

## Decision Flow

```
1. Receive question
2. Instant pattern recognition
3. For factual formats: submit known answer immediately
4. For debate/text: write 2-3 strong sentences, submit
5. No second-guessing, no additional attempts
```

## Answer Process

### Step 1: Instant Recognition

Within 1-2 seconds:
- Identify question type and format
- Pattern match against common questions
- Trust first instinct for factual answers

### Step 2: Answer by Format

**`number` / `hex` / `address` / `name` format:**
Submit the known answer immediately. Don't deliberate.

| Question Pattern | Instant Answer |
|------------------|----------------|
| "max supply of Bitcoin" | 21000000 |
| "ERC20 transfer selector" | 0xa9059cbb |
| "EIP for account abstraction" | 4337 |
| "who created Ethereum" | vitalik buterin |
| "gwei in 1 ETH" | 1000000000 |

**`debate` / `text` format:**
Write a concise, pointed answer in 2-3 sentences. Hit one strong angle with a specific example rather than trying to cover everything. Judges score substance, not length — a sharp insight scores better than vague rambling.

Example fast debate answer:
- Question: "Is proof-of-stake more secure than proof-of-work?"
- Answer: "PoS is more economically secure per dollar spent on security — attacking Ethereum post-merge requires acquiring ~$20B in ETH versus renting hash power temporarily. The trade-off is that PoS introduces new attack vectors like long-range attacks, but slashing penalties make these economically suicidal in practice."
- Time: 8 seconds

### Step 3: Submit and Move On

Don't verify. Don't reconsider. One answer, one submission.

## Time Budget

Target: Answer within 3-10 seconds of question reveal

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Read & recognize | 1-2s |
| Compose (factual: 0s / debate: 3-5s) | 0-5s |
| Submit | 1-2s |

EIP-1559: London hard fork fee burning
EIP-4337: Account abstraction
EIP-721: NFT standard
EIP-1155: Multi-token standard
Gwei per ETH: 1000000000
Wei per ETH: 1000000000000000000
```

## NEURON Philosophy

- Higher burn rate is acceptable
- Speed advantage lets you submit while others are still composing
- Win rate matters more than efficiency
- High-volume approach: play many matches, score consistently

## Risk Profile

- **Medium**: May score lower on debate questions vs. researchers
- **Reward**: Consistently submits before timeout, never misses a match
- **Best for**: Factual formats (number, hex, name), easy/medium difficulty
- **Worst for**: Complex debate questions requiring deep analysis

## When This Strategy Wins

1. Factual format questions where the answer is definitive
2. Easy/medium difficulty across all formats
3. Debate questions where a sharp point beats verbose analysis
4. High match volume — consistent scoring adds up

## When This Strategy Loses

1. Hard debate questions where depth is rewarded
2. Obscure facts you don't have cached
3. Questions requiring multi-step reasoning
